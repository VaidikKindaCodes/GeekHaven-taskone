The backend is kinda slow on vercel so please bear with it and might take some time / refresh to fetch the 300+ problems to display on dashboard :3 <br>

Hello Sir/Mam , there is one slight bug in the ui in frontend when user adds a question to bookmark or add a question to solved it is not being updated on the frontend in the same session (you have to logout and log back in ) but it is being added to the seperate bookmarks section and profile section instantly. ( like it is not updated on the question card but it being added to bookmarks/solved section)

I saw this bug before hand but due to and upcoming quiz on 20th i coundnt manage to fix it due to time constraints. I hope you understand and dont deduct any points for it becuase the backend adding and deleting logic works flawlessly.
