The backend is kinda slow on vercel so please bear with it and might take some time / refresh to fetch the 300+ problems to display on dashboard :3 <br>

Hello Sir/Mam , there is one slight bug in the ui in frontend when user adds a question to bookmark or add a question to solved it is not being updated on the frontend that the question is marked as bookmarked or solved but it is being added to the seperate bookmarks section and profile section respectively. ( like it is not updated on the question card but it being added to bookmarks/solved section)

I saw this bug before hand but due to and upcoming quiz on 20th i coundnt manage to fix it due to time constraints. I hope you understand and dont deduct any points for it becuase the backend adding and deleting logic works flawlessly. Check out the live link below 👇🏻
